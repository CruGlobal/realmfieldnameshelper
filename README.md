# Realm Field Names Helper

This library auto-generate helper classes that can help make Realm queries more type safe.
For each Realm model class a corresponding `<class>Fields` class is created with static references
to all queryable field names.

## Installation

Just include the following dependency in your `gradle.build` file

```gradle
compile 'dk.ilios:realmfieldnames:1.0.0'
```

## Usage

The library adds an annotation processor that automatically detects all Realm model classes and
generated an extra class called `<className>Fields`. This class will contain static references
to all field names, which can then be used when creating queries.

```java
// Standard Realm Model class
public class Person extends RealmObject {
    private String name;
    private boolean hasDogs; // camel case naming gets converted to uppercase separated by "_"
    private boolean mHasCats; // Hungarian notation is evil but support for m starting prefix.
    private boolean has_fish; // fields already using "_" are just converted as they are.

    @Ignore
    private int random;

    // Getters and setters ...
}

// This class is automatically generated by this library
public class PersonFields {
    public static final String NAME = "name";
    public static final String HAS_DOGS = "hasDogs";
    public static final String HAS_CATS = "mHasCats";
    public static final String HAS_FISH = "has_fish";

}

// And can be used when creating queries
Realm realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance();
RealmResults<Person> results = realm.where(Person.class)
                                    .equalTo(PersonFields.NAME, "John")
                                    .findAll();
```

## About this library

Even though I am a contributor to Realm, this project is not officially affiliated with Realm and
was created purely to scratch an itch in a side project I was working on.

Use it with that it mind.
